 To begin with, it is beneficial to know the shape of the tables and whether any column has null values.
 Further in this segment, you will take a look at 'movies' and 'genre' tables.*/



-- Segment 1:




-- Q1. Find the total number of rows in each table of the schema?
-- Type your code below:
show tables;
select count(*) from director_mapping;
select count(*) from genre;
select count(*) from movie;
select count(*) from names;
select count(*) from rating;
select count(*) from role_mapping;









-- Q2. Which columns in the movie table have null values?
-- Type your code below:
show tables;
select* from movie;
select count(1) from movie where worlwide_gross_income is null;
select count(1) from movie where id  is null;
select count(1) from movie where title is null;
select count(1) from movie where year is null;
select count(1) from movie where date_published is null;
select count(1) from movie where duration is null;
select count(1) from movie where country is null;
select count(1) from movie where languages is null;
select count(1) from movie where production_company is null;



-- Now as you can see four columns of the movie table has null values. Let's look at the at the movies released each year. 
-- Q3. Find the total number of movies released each year? How does the trend look month wise? (Output expected)

/*The highest number of movies is produced in the month of March.
So, now that you have understood the month-wise trend of movies, let’s take a look at the other details in the movies table. 
We know USA and India produces huge number of movies each year. Lets find the number of movies produced by USA or India for the last year.*/
  
-- Q4. How many movies were produced in the USA or India in the year 2019??
-- Type your code below:
select* from movie;
select Count(id) as number_of_movies, year from movie where( country like '%INDIA%' or country like '%USA%' )and year = 2019;

Exploring table Genre would be fun!! 
Let’s find out the different genres in the dataset.*/

-- Q5. Find the unique list of the genres present in the data set?
-- Type your code below:
select* from movie;
show tables;
select* from genre;
select distinct genre from genre;









/* So, RSVP Movies plans to make a movie of one of these genres.
Now, wouldn’t you want to know which genre had the highest number of movies produced in the last year?
Combining both the movie and genres table can give more interesting insights. */

-- Q6.Which genre had the highest number of movies produced overall?
-- Type your code below:

from genre g inner join movie m 
on

group by genre
order by num_of_mvs desc limit 1;









/* So, based on the insight that you just drew, RSVP Movies should focus on the ‘Drama’ genre. 
But wait, it is too early to decide. A movie can belong to two or more genres. 
So, let’s find out the count of movies that belong to only one genre.*/

-- Q7. How many movies belong to only one genre?
-- Type your code below:

/* There are more than three thousand movies which has only one genre associated with them.
So, this figure appears significant.

-- Q8.What is the average duration of movies in each genre? 
-- (Note: The same movie can belong to multiple genres.)
